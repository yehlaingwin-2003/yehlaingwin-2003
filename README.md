## 👨‍💻 About Me  

Hi, I’m **Ye Hlaing Win** — a full stack developer from Myanmar.  

🌱 **My Journey**  
After a challenging first year in polytechnic, I decided to **restart from scratch**. Instead of giving up, I began rebuilding my skills through **hands-on projects** — because I believe real learning comes from creating.  

⚽ **Beyond Code**  
When I’m not coding, you’ll find me **playing soccer**, 🎸 **jamming on guitar**, or 🎤 **singing** — activities that keep me creative and balanced.  

📚 **What Inspires Me**  
One of my favorite books, *Atomic Habits*, reminds me that **small, consistent steps lead to big results** — a principle I live by in both life and coding.  

🎥 **Sharing the Journey**  
I recently started a **YouTube channel** to document my struggles, challenges, and progress — hoping to inspire others who are on the same path.
