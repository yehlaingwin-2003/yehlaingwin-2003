## <h3><i>🙋 About Me</i></h3>

I’m **Ye Hlaing Win**, a full stack developer from Myanmar.  
After struggling during my first year in polytechnic, I chose to restart from scratch — learning by doing and growing through real projects.  

Outside of coding, I enjoy ⚽ playing soccer, 🎸 playing guitar, and 🎤 singing.  
One of the books that inspires me most is *Atomic Habits*, a reminder that small steps can lead to big change.  

I also recently started a 🎥 YouTube channel to share my journey, the challenges I face, and how I overcome them.
